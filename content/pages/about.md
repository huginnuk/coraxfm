Founded in 2017, we aren't a normal accounting practice. We are a complete outsourced finance team.

Based in the North East, serving customers across the UK, we leverage the latest in IT and cloud technology to bring you financial information you can depend on.

Our aim is to give you and your business the finance team it deserves. No more unexpected accountancy bills. No more out of scope work. We aim to be an extension of your company and add real value.

We are a [CIMA](https://www.cimaglobal.com/About-us/Find-a-CIMA-Accountant/Tom-Lee-Gough-Accounting-13911/) practice, which means that we focus on giving you the tools you need to maximise your businesses performance.  

We can work with you to:

- Understand your numbers
- Improve profit
- Simplify your finance function
- Ensure statutory compliance
