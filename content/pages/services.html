				                    <p>Corax FM can offer you fixed fee self-assessment (SA100) tax returns. HMRC will tell you if you need to file a self-assessment (SA100). You will need to file a self-assessment if you have any income that is not taxed PAYE. This could be from your own business, a side-gig, or if you are a company director.</p>
				                    <p>Send us an email or complete our simple online form and we can start looking at your self-assessment.</p>

				                    <h3>Company Accounts</h3>
				                    <p>If you are a director, you will have to submit a self-assessment (SA100) and a corporation tax return (SA600) to HMRC. And you will have to file your accounts with Companies House. Corax FM can take care of all of this as in a single fixed fee package. Completing your accounts doesn't have to be complex.</p>

				                    <p>Corax FM can also process payroll if you employ staff or file your VAT returns if you are VAT registered. These are done for a fixed fee, so that there are no surprises.</p>

				                    <p>Corax FM offers a Virtual Finance Director service. We will discuss what you think that you are missing from the business and will set up reporting to give you the information you need.</p>
