I've been reading about online advertising and marketing. Most online advertising organisations say that the can measure the ROI (Return On Investment) of advertising spend. It reminds me of a TV commercial in the early '00's from Adobe, where a bunch of corporate types discuss marketing and ask "What's the ROI on that?" Adobe claimed that they could, in fact, measure the ROI on that. Facebook and Google et al, have lots more data on their users, and so have more credibility to claim that they can target adverts better, giving a higher ROI.

## Sales funnel
Many marketers talk about the (sales funnel)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchase_funnel]. It is a way of identifying at what stage your potential customer is of making a purchase. Marketing activity differs for potential customers at different stages of the funnel.

## Search Rankings
Where you appear in the search results list is important. Users do not like to look through several pages to find what they are looking for. There are literlly millions of websites that will give you the techniques to rank higher for a given topic.

## Paid Search







DISCLAIMER: I am not an expert in this area. I think that Google and Facebook et al are not telling the truth about the efficacy of their advertising channels.

## Background

I've been reading about online marketing. Specifically, paid search and SEO and how they interact. SEO is Search Engine Optimisation - essentially these are the techniques that you should use to appear near the top of the results lists on Google. Presumably, these techniques would work with other search providers, but apparently SEO practitioners do not recognise other search engines. Paid search is when an advertiser buys an advert to appear in your search results. It seems to be pretty well established that appearing on the first results page is important as traffic to websites on subsequent results pages drops off.

## Paid Search

Despite what the online advertisers say, I do not believe that you can measure the ROI (Return On Investment) of advertising and marketing. Establishing causality requires [some very complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_conditional_heteroskedasticity) statistics. From what I have seen from the likes of Google, it is not that complex. If you are using Google's suite of tools to place adverts and track website visitors, Google will attempt to attribute the revenue to the source of the traffic.
